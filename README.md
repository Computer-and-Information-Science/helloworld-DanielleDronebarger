Change the code so that instead of saying "Hello World" it says "Hello Object Oriented Programming", and then compile and test. 
Additionally try these out and see what errors you get. Document your errors here in the readme. (This is taken from Exercise 3 in the text book).

Starting with the Hello World program, try out each of the following errors. After you make each change, compile the program, read the error message (if there is one), and then fix the error.

Remove one of the opening curly braces.-Syntax error on token "HelloWorld", { expected after this token

Remove one of the closing curly braces.-Syntax error, insert "}" to complete ClassBody

Instead of main, write mian.-Error: Main method not found in class HelloWorld, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

Remove the word static.-Error: Main method is not static in class HelloWorld, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)

Remove the word public.-Error: Main method not found in class HelloWorld, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application

Remove the word System.-Syntax error on token ".", delete this token

Replace println with Println.-The method Println(String) is undefined for the type PrintStream

Replace println with print.- @DanielleDronebarger puts itself on the same line as the sentence

Delete one parenthesis.-Syntax error, insert "}" to complete ClassBody ,Syntax error on token "[", ] expected after this token,Syntax error on token "}", delete this token

Add an extra parenthesis.-Syntax error, insert "}" to complete ClassBody,Syntax error on token "]", delete this token,
Syntax error on token "}", delete this token

Fix the code so it works and commit your changes.
